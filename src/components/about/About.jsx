          Full Stack Software Developer with 8+ years of work experience across
          technical, educational, commerce, health, logistics, construction, and
          finance sectors using a variety of technologies such as Javascript,
          Nodejs, TypeScript, and PHP with expertise in frontend and backend
          development. Iâ€™m a solution-driven web developer who has built and
          also led teams of very smart people in creating and delivering
          user-centric applications and solutions. I thrive in a fast-paced

          projects, implementing SOLID principles, CLEAN architecture, MVVM, MVI
          or MVC, Design patterns, Test Driven Development for scalability,
          Continuous Integration and Delivery, and Agile Best Practices. I also
          gained hands-on expertise in REST APIs.
